Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to find relationship between two values (OR)
relational operators are used to compare two values.
Relational operators are binary operators which required 2 operands
Relational operators after comparing values it return Boolean values
(True/False). An expression which returns Boolean value is called logical
expression or Boolean expression.
In python relational operators are used to compare numbers and
sequences (strings, list, tuple, bytes,â€¦)

'''

#  greaterthan > This operator return True, if opr1 is greater opr2

#find greater than 2 number

# n1=int(input("Enter first number:")) 
# n2=int(input("Enter second number:")) 
# print(n1,"is max") if n1>n2 else print(n2,"is max")

'''   >= This operator returns True, if opr1>=opr2 else return False.
this operator verify two conditions > and ==

# write a program to find a person is elg to vote or not

# name=input("Enter name: ")
# age=int(input("Enter age: ")) 
# print(name,"is eligiable to vote") if age>=18 else print(name,"not eligiable to vote")

#login application

# user=input("UserName:") # nit
# pwd=input("Password:") # nit123
# print("welcome") if user=="ram" and pwd=="ram123" else print("invalid username or password")

# write a program to find input character is vowel or not
# ch=input("Enter any character:")
# print("vowel") if ch=='a' or ch=='e' or ch=='i' or ch=='o' or ch=='u' else print("not vowel")
# print("vowel") if ch in "AEIOUaeiou" else print("not vowel")
