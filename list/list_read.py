# What is index?
# Index is an integer value which is used to identify each location or value in
# list/sequence. This index can be +ve or â€“ve
# +VE index starts at 0, which is used to read elements in forward direction
# (Left to Right)
# -VE index starts at -1, which is used to read elements in backward direction
# (Right to Left)
# Index is used to read only one value/element from list
# It allows reading in sequential or random order
